# Summary

This is just a chassis for an universal robot.

It is designed to be used with these geared motors: https://es.aliexpress.com/item/TT-Motor-Smart-Car-Robot-Gear-Motor-for-Arduino-Free-Shipping-Wholesale/32536140897.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.njUfwv
It is not necessary to paste the motors, they just fit in the structure and you can put them in very easily.

The structure that it has in the frontal part is there to support a sensors lot, because I use it as line follower, but this part is just optional.

I use a ball caster as a third wheel.
